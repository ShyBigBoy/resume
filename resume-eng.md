## Summary

I am an Android developer who deeply love **open source**. I'd like to share my code which may help developers, and they can submit issues to improve the code. I am passionate about building **high quality** apps which have **good user interfaces**. In this case, I create a repository, **[AndroidStandardDevelop](https://github.com/Blankj/AndroidStandardDevelop)**, which is well received to help developers practice best in Android. Beyond that, I focus on the development efficiency and knowledge accumulation. I created **[AndroidUtilCode](https://github.com/Blankj/AndroidUtilCode)** which has received more than **16k stars** to help developers develop more efficient. Of course, as a programmer, I also pay attention to data structures and algorithms. I create  **[awesome-java-leetcode](https://github.com/Blankj/awesome-java-leetcode)** to solve the problems in LeetCode.
